00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,340
Hello everyone, this is a video on how to use this website.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,380
So for those who don't know,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,920
this website is where you can upload an audio or video file.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,560
And the website will provide you an SRD file,

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,300
which is the format of a subtitle file in return.

6
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:19,760
And you can upload that file to your editing software and it will do the subtitles automatically for you.

7
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:21,780
And so first, let us login.

8
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,200
Here you can register an account on our website by this button,

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,720
or you can reset your password if you forget it.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,600
But here now we will use Google login first.

11
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:35,240
And the website will do its job here.

12
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:36,280
Okay,

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,540
so this page is the main transcript page where your uploaded transcript will be listed here.

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,040
And if you want to add a transcript,

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,060
you click this upload file button.

16
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:51,240
And you can drag a file or select a file in here.

17
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:52,440
Okay.

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,360
And this place is for you to enter the initial prompt.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,520
And the initial prompt is basically like a sentence of few that describe what the audio

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,420
is about and clarifies under the names.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,980
So the transcription AI can do its work better.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,780
So an example of a prompt will be this.

23
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,780
The transcript is about OpenAI,

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,100
which makes technology a Dalai GPT-3 and chat GPT with the hope of one day building an ATS system that benefits all of humanity.

25
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:21,200
And what this prompt does,

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,380
it's basically provide the AI the context

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,180
of the audio and clarifies under the names like GPT-3,

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,580
chat GPT and Dalai,

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,000
which would make the transcription more accurate.

30
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,320
Okay.

31
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,040
And this is where you can choose if you want to

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,620
translate your subtitles to English.

33
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:39,940
And let us just submit now.

34
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:43,520
And before this, before this message shows up,

35
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:45,740
you can't close your file because it's so upload,

36
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,180
you can't close the browser because it's so uploading.

37
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,760
And after it's done uploading,

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,520
your transcript job will be here.

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,600
And it's currently running in the background.

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,660
So I can leave this page without problems.

41
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,180
And if you want to reach out to us,

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,140
if you have any problems,

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,820
you want to contact us or

44
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,040

please feel free to use this email to reach out to us.

46
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,720
Let's head back to the dashboard page.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,420
Okay, it's done.

48
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,340
It will say it's done successfully.

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,740
Refers to see your friends here.

50
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,160
Okay, so this is the view transcript page.

51
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,260
This would be a file name.

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,920
And this is the upload time.

53
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,900
And you can play your audio here.

54
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Hey, buddy, how was school?

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,660
Everybody?

56
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:29,440
And here you can see the transcript.

57
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,820
This is a timestamp of each line.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,660
And this is the

59
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,200
titles according to the timestamp.

60
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,220
Okay.

61
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,420
And you have three buttons here.

62
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:41,280
First, you can copy the transcript through clipboards like without timestamps.

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
And you can copy

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,880
it at any place you want.

65
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,460
And next, you can export the file,

66
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:48,820
which you click download.

67
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,660
And it would export the SRD file for you.

68
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,520
And last, you can delete this transcript,

69
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:59,600
which you will just press delete and it'll be deleted.

70
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,400
Yep.

71
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:08,940
And for those who don't have editing software like Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro that supports uploading SRD file,

72
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,040
you can go to this website named Clidio.

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,900
First, you want to choose your video,

74
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,240
you upload it.

75
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:21,000
And next, it will allow you to upload a SRD file in there.

76
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay.

77
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:26,040
And it takes a few seconds to run.

78
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:27,680
That's perfectly normal.

79
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,300
And basically,

80
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,600
we are a transcript,

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,700
so you can log out.

82
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:40,760
You can log in with another account, anything like that.
